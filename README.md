<h1>Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to build a system that allows users to predict or check the Bitcoin price on a given date using machine learning techniques.</p>

<h2>Motivation / Importance</h2>
<p>
  Since Bitcoin is highly volatile and unpredictable, price forecasting becomes useful for investors, traders, and researchers. That motivated me to work on this problem and build a practical system.
</p>

<h2>Algorithm / Model Used</h2>
<p>
  I used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm because it works well with non-linear data and provides strong generalization. Initially, I tested simpler models like Linear Regression, but they didnâ€™t perform well due to the complex nature of Bitcoin prices. SVM with an RBF kernel gave better results.
</p>

<h2>Tech Stack / Tools</h2>
<p>
  For the implementation, I used <strong>Python</strong> along with libraries like 
  <strong>scikit-learn</strong>, <strong>pandas</strong>, and <strong>NumPy</strong> 
  for model training and evaluation. For system integration, I used 
  <strong>Flask</strong> as the backend framework and 
  <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> 
  for building the frontend user interface.
